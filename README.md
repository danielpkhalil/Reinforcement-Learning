## Environments
The following environments have been explored in this repository:

1. **FrozenLake**: A gridworld environment where the agent must navigate a frozen lake and avoid falling into holes.

2. **CartPole**: The agent must balance a pole on a cart for as long as possible.

3. **Humanoid**: A complex MuJoCo environment where a humanoid agent must learn to walk.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms have been implemented:

1. **Q-Learning**: Used for solving the FrozenLake and CartPole environments.
2. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: Used for solving the Humanoid environment.
3. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Used for solving the CartPole environment.

## Getting Started
To run the algorithms, first install the necessary dependencies, then simply run the corresponding python file or notebook for each environment and algorithm.

## Future Work
More environments and algorithms to come
