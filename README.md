# Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms applied to different environments. The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Environments
1. **FrozenLake**: A gridworld environment where the agent must navigate a frozen lake and avoid falling into holes.

2. **CartPole**: The agent must balance a pole on a cart for as long as possible.

3. **BlackJack**: The agent's goal is to win at Blackjack.

4. **Humanoid**: A complex MuJoCo environment where a humanoid agent must learn to walk.

## Algorithms
1. **Q-Learning**: Used for solving the FrozenLake and CartPole environments.
2. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: Used for solving the Humanoid environment.
3. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Used for solving the CartPole environment.

## Getting Started
To run the algorithms, first install the necessary dependencies, then simply run the corresponding python file or notebook for each environment and algorithm.

## Future Work
More environments and algorithms to come
